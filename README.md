# Landing-Page
Very simple landing page that I created using HTML/CSS. I used mailchimp for the contact form and animate.style for the bouncing text. Furthermore I used bootstrap for features such as the button and for aligning my content and making it fully responsive. This is simply just a very basic introductory project for me to get a taste, from here I aim to develop my skills greatly.
